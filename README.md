## AirBNB

This project brings together a modern and intuitive frontend with a full-stack architecture. Technologies used:

**Frontend:**
 * React: For building dynamic and component-based user interfaces.
 * Tailwind CSS: Providing rapid styling and customisation.

**Full-Stack:** 
 * Demonstrates understanding of both frontend and backend integration concepts (even with simulated backend functionality at this stage).

### Functionalities

 * **Host Functionality:** Create and edit listings.
 * **User View:** See a catalog of live, bookable residences.
 * **Search Filtering:** Allow users to filter listings based on their desired criteria
 * **Booking System:** Enable users to select dates, view pricing, calculate costs, and complete secure reservations.
 * **Reviews and Ratings:** Allow guests to leave reviews and ratings for both properties and hosts.

### How to Run
